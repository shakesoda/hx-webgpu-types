Generated and modified as needed for internal use in my projects, but I was asked about releasing these. May be slightly behind the latest spec, but should be close as of this writing (2023-03-19).

Tested with haxe 4.2.5 and Chrome Dev 113.0.5653 on arm64.

It is highly likely that the cruft in the `js` folder can largely be removed, and that the global namespace should be changed.
